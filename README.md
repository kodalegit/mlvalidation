# Ujenzi
A web application built using Django and React that enables the prediction of concrete strength from several parameters.

## Description
Ujenzi is a web application that utilizes a machine-learning model to predict concrete strength from several parameters such as the content of water, cement, fine and coarse aggregate, blast furnace slag and fly ash. The underlying ML model used in this project is trained on data from the [UC Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/165/concrete+compressive+strength). You can find further technical documentation on this project [here](https://ujenzi.tech/documentation).

The application backend is built using Django(Python) and the frontend is built using React(JavaScript).
